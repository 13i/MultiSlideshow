MultiSlideshow
==============

A Mootools class that is able to create smooth multiple slideshows on a page using Fx.Elements.

Any ressemblance with [Ryan Florence Slideshow Class](https://github.com/rpflorence/SlideShow) is of course assumed, we used this class in every single website we build at 13i and think this is the best slideshow class but we couldn't get it effective with a lot of slideshows on a siglepage.
